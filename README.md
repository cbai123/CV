## Chris Bailey

I am a recent graduate from the Makers Academy software bootcamp. Before that I graduated from the University of Bath with an MEng in Aerospace Engineering. 

During my degree I got to work on multiple design projects, starting from a humble table tennis ball launcher through to my final year project of designing and partially building a hybrid rocket engine. While completing my degree I found much more enjoyment in the brief amount of coding I did. 

I love problem solving and the buzz achieved by working things out, software development allows me to get that buzz all while producing projects I care about. To be able to start from scratch and finish with something I can be proud of really drove me to succeed on the Makers course.

## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.
(Using a STAR example Paragraph) Consider the questions below.

-STAR
-What was the situation/task? (ST)

-How was the skill used?

-What did you do? (action)

-What was the result?


#### This Skill

- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence (STAR)

#### Another Skill

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed (again use STAR for this)

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

## Education

#### Makers Academy (10/10/22 to 10/02/23)

- Used pair programming to solve problems and increase understanding. Involved teamwork and communication.
- Used TDD to build programs with high test coverage. Aided in planning and understanding program before writing code.
- Started with Ruby building command line apps, then a Twitter clone and a BnB website.
- Ruby projects tested with RSpec. Learned to test first, write later. Wrote unit and integration tests, and learned mocking, including mocking API calls.
- Learned SQL and no SQL database usage. PostgreSQL and MongoDB. Learned methods for one-to-many and many-to-many relationships. And, how to interact with the databases for CRUD purposes.
- Learned about HTTP requests and responses. How to write and handle them, and how to test HTTP responses.
- Moved onto Javascript, testing with Jest.
- Started working with Javascript, began with command line apps. Learned about asynchronous programming. Learned testing with Jest, unit and integration tests, and mocking.
- Began to work on webpages, handling DOM elements, writing HTML, using Javascript to update the page, and using CSS.
- Built a Facebook clone website using the MERN stack, included end to end testing using Cypress.
- Built a website using React Native, Express.js, MongoDB, Node.js and several external APIs, including Google Maps.

#### University of Bath (01/10/2018 to 01/08/2022)

- MEng(Hons) Aerospace Engineering
- 2:1
- Final year project involved helping design and build a hybrid rocket engine. My role was focused on the liquid oxidiser storage and feed system.
- Worked on several group and solo projects

#### Royal Latin School (01/09/16 to 01/08/2018)

#### A levels
- Mathematics - A*
- Physics - A*
- Chemistry - A*
- AS Biology - A

#### Royal Latin School (01/09/11 to 01/08/2016)

#### GCSEs
- 11 A* to B including:
- Mathematics A*
- English Language A
