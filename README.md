## Chris Bailey

I am a recent graduate from the Makers Academy software bootcamp. Before that I graduated from the University of Bath with an MEng in Aerospace Engineering. 

During my degree I got to work on multiple design projects, starting from a humble table tennis ball launcher through to my final year project of designing and partially building a hybrid rocket engine. While completing my degree I found much more enjoyment in the brief amount of coding I did. 

I love problem solving and the buzz achieved by working things out, software development allows me to get that buzz all while producing projects I care about. To be able to start from scratch and finish with something I can be proud of really drove me to succeed on the Makers course.

## Skills

#### My ability to learn and teach myself

I had to teach myself to use structural analysis software. [(Finite Element Analysis, FEA)](https://www.autodesk.co.uk/solutions/finite-element-analysis)

I used the software to aid in my final two projects at university. It helped speed up design and testing of parts, and in my final project the analysis was verified using experiments.

In a group project we needed to do structural analysis on parts for the project. We needed this as evidence for the final report and to produce pictures of stress in parts.

I used my housemateâ€™s notes from a module not available to me and the internet to teach myself how to use the software. I was able to model simple structural problems and verify them with hand calculations to assure I would be capable of using this technique to perform more complex calculations.

I modelled all required parts and performed the needed structural analysis for the team. I was also then able to use these skills in a project the following year when the team needed someone who knew how to use the software. I achieved strong results on my reports that included results from the analysis. In my final project the part was a pressure chamber which we were able to have built and assembled, we then performed pressure testing on the part which verified my results from the structural analysis.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (10/10/22 to 10/02/23)

- Used pair programming to solve problems and increase understanding. Involved teamwork and communication.
- Used TDD to build programs with high test coverage. Aided in planning and understanding program before writing code.
- Started with Ruby building command line apps, then a Twitter clone and a BnB website.
- Ruby projects tested with RSpec. Learned to test first, write later. Wrote unit and integration tests, and learned mocking, including mocking API calls.
- Learned SQL and no SQL database usage. PostgreSQL and MongoDB. Learned methods for one-to-many and many-to-many relationships. And, how to interact with the databases for CRUD purposes.
- Learned about HTTP requests and responses. How to write and handle them, and how to test HTTP responses.
- Moved onto Javascript, testing with Jest.
- Started working with Javascript, began with command line apps. Learned about asynchronous programming. Learned testing with Jest, unit and integration tests, and mocking.
- Began to work on webpages, handling DOM elements, writing HTML, using Javascript to update the page, and using CSS.
- Built a Facebook clone website using the MERN stack, included end to end testing using Cypress.
- Built a website using React Native, Express.js, MongoDB, Node.js and several external APIs, including Google Maps.

#### University of Bath (01/10/2018 to 01/08/2022)

- MEng(Hons) Aerospace Engineering
- 2:1
- Final year project involved helping design and build a hybrid rocket engine. My role was focused on the liquid oxidiser storage and feed system.
- Worked on several group and solo projects

#### Royal Latin School (01/09/16 to 01/08/2018)

#### A levels
- Mathematics - A*
- Physics - A*
- Chemistry - A*
- AS Biology - A

#### Royal Latin School (01/09/11 to 01/08/2016)

#### GCSEs
- 11 A* to B including:
- Mathematics A*
