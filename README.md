## Chris Bailey

I am a recent graduate from the Makers Academy software bootcamp. Before that I graduated from the University of Bath with an MEng in Aerospace Engineering. 

During my degree I got to work on multiple design projects, starting from a humble table tennis ball launcher through to my final year project of designing and partially building a hybrid rocket engine. While completing my degree I found much more enjoyment in the brief amount of coding I did. 

I love problem solving and the buzz achieved by working things out, software development allows me to get that buzz all while producing projects I care about. To be able to start from scratch and finish with something I can be proud of really drove me to succeed on the Makers course.

## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.
(Using a STAR example Paragraph) Consider the questions below.

-STAR
-What was the situation/task? (ST)

-How was the skill used?

-What did you do? (action)

-What was the result?


#### This Skill

- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence (STAR)

#### Another Skill

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed (again use STAR for this)

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)
