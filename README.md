## Chris Bailey

I am a recent graduate from the Makers Academy software bootcamp. Before that I graduated from the University of Bath with an MEng in Aerospace Engineering. 

During my degree I got to work on multiple design projects, starting from a humble table tennis ball launcher through to my final year project of designing and partially building a hybrid rocket engine. While completing my degree I found much more enjoyment in the brief amount of coding I did. 

I love problem solving and the buzz achieved by working things out, software development allows me to get that buzz all while producing projects I care about. To be able to start from scratch and finish with something I can be proud of really drove me to succeed on the Makers course.

| [**ReelPlaces**](https://github.com/cbai123/ReelPlaces)                   | A webapp that allows users to search for movies filmed in a specific city. They can then see on a map where in the city scenes were filmed. | Javascript, MongoDB, Express.js, React Native, Node.js, Google Maps API, Jest |
| [**AceBook**](https://github.com/cbai123/acebook-mern-priceless)                      |  A clone of FaceBook based on a partially complete codebase. Involved having to get up to speed and comfortable with existing codebase. Included posting text and images, comments, reacting to posts, and custom user profile pages | Javascript, MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js, Jest, Cypress              |
| [**Bank Tech Test**](https://github.com/cbai123/bank_tech_test)               | A command line app allowing a user to keep track of bank deposits, withdrawals, and balance. | Javascript, Jest |

## Work Experience

**Swanbourne House School (2016 to 2018)  
Junior Kitchen Assistant**

Involved working in a team and on my own to set up dining room, serve to children and staff, wash up dishes, and clean cooking spaces.
- Built confidence in my decision making
- Helped with working to time constraints
- Teamwork
- Problem solving involved in deciding how to tackle tasks quickest

## Skills

### My ability to learn, and teach myself

In a group project, structural analysis was needed to provide evidence for the final report and to produce pictures of stress in parts.

I had to teach myself how to use structural analysis software [(Finite Element Analysis, FEA)](https://www.autodesk.co.uk/solutions/finite-element-analysis) as it was not covered in my modules.
 
#### What did I do?
- I used my housemate's notes from a module not available to me and the internet to teach myself how to use the software.
- I modeled simple structural problems and verified them with hand calculations to ensure I could perform more complex calculations.
- I then modeled all required parts and performed necessary structural analysis for the group project.

#### What was the result?
- The group project was successful, and we achieved strong results on reports that included results from the analysis.
- I was able to use these skills in a project the following year when the team needed someone with expertise in the software.
- In my final project, the part was a pressure chamber that was built and assembled, and we performed pressure testing on the part which verified my results from the structural analysis.

### Problem Solving

I participated in numerous university engineering projects, both group and solo. Including designing: a table tennis ball launcher, a mechanism for a convertible roof, a section of an aeroplane wing, a hybrid rocket engine (which was partially built), and others.

I achieved high results on my projects throughout university and graduated with a 2:1

One group project was to design a hybrid rocket engine with two other students.
I was responsible for designing a system to deliver oxidiser to the engine.

I had to design a part that would fit into the combustion chamber, but the space available was very limited and could not be changed.

#### What did I do?
- Redesigned the part to make it smaller, which affected its performance but allowed it to fit into the combustion chamber.
- Requested that another part of the combustion chamber be modified slightly to accommodate the redesigned part.
- Assembled the combustion chamber and tested it to make sure it could handle the pressure it would be under.

#### What was the result?
- Successfully designed a part that could fit into the combustion chamber without making major changes to the design.
- Tested the combustion chamber and confirmed that it could handle the pressure it would be under.
- Predicted that the part would work based on computer models.
- Achieved a high 2:1 in my report and presentation on the project.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (10/10/22 to 10/02/23)

- Used pair programming to solve problems and increase understanding. Involved teamwork and communication.
- Used TDD to build programs with high test coverage. Aided in planning and understanding program before writing code.
- Started with Ruby building command line apps, then a Twitter clone and a BnB website.
- Ruby projects tested with RSpec. Learned to test first, write later. Wrote unit and integration tests, and learned mocking, including mocking API calls.
- Learned SQL and no SQL database usage. PostgreSQL and MongoDB. Learned methods for one-to-many and many-to-many relationships. And, how to interact with the databases for CRUD purposes.
- Learned about HTTP requests and responses. How to write and handle them, and how to test HTTP responses.
- Moved onto Javascript, testing with Jest.
- Started working with Javascript, began with command line apps. Learned about asynchronous programming. Learned testing with Jest, unit and integration tests, and mocking.
- Began to work on webpages, handling DOM elements, writing HTML, using Javascript to update the page, and using CSS.
- Built a Facebook clone website using the MERN stack, included end to end testing using Cypress.
- Built a website using React Native, Express.js, MongoDB, Node.js and several external APIs, including Google Maps.
