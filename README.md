## Christopher Bailey

I am a recent graduate from the University of Bath in aerospace engineering, looking to switch to a tech career. During my time at university I engaged in multiple design projects from a table tennis ball launcher to a hybrid rocket engine. The biggest interaction I had with coding was using MATLAB, mainly for data manipulation and plotting. I am excited by the problem solving aspects of tech, and the ability to create something that can be useful and improve the lives of others.

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.
(Using a STAR example Paragraph) Consider the questions below.

-STAR
-What was the situation/task? (ST)

-How was the skill used?

-What did you do? (action)

-What was the result?


#### This Skill

- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence (STAR)

#### Another Skill

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed (again use STAR for this)

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)
